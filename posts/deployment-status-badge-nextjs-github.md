First and foremost is FreeBSD. On top of that, I use the xmonad tiling window manager.

On top of xmonad, I spend almost all of my time in terminals (urxvt) and web browsers (Firefox). I run my terminals inside a tmux session.

In half of my multitudinous terminal sessions, you will find Vim instances.

I rely heavily on keyboard shortcuts for my favourite applications. In fact, most of the time I have the mouse/trackpad disabled.

In addition to these major parts of my working environment, I lean on a number of tools, programming languages, message queues, and database systems to build my software. To name a few:

Tools: SSH, KeePassXC, Git, ranger, Mutt, VSCode.

Languages: Zsh, Node, Express, TypeScript, React, Next.js.

MQ and DB: Redis, RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ, Postgres, SQLite, MongoDB.
