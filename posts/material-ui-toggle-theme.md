I use an Intel® Core i5-4460 CPU @ 3.20GHz

16GB DDR3 RAM

7.200rpm HDD's: 1x Seagate 1TB; 1x Western Digital 500GB; 2x Western Digital Black Edition 1TB;

Optical 10Gbit cable with 1Gbit hardware ethernet connection, but limited to 100mbit upload/download internet speed ;(

I also keep an older ThinkPad on my desk that does run Windows.

Before that, I used an Intel® Core2 Quad Processor Q6600 @ 2.40GHz

Before that, I used an Intel® Pentium® 4 Processor 550 @ 3.40GHz

Before that, I used an Intel® Celeron® Processor 533MHz
